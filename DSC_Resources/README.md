# Resources

The Resources can be a mix of DSC Resource and DSC Composite Resource, 
as long as their logical function is focused on a technology or stack.
As an example, we use Chocolatey to manage our software delivery.

The composition of different technology should happen in a higher level,
most likely in the [DSC_Configurations](../DSC_Configurations/README.md) folder.
